Abisola Afolabi-Jombo's IoT Energy Monitoring Solution - Framework Documentation

1. Introduction
XYZ Limited requires a cost-effective, real-time, and serverless AWS-native solution to monitor energy consumption in an apartment using an IoT box. This document outlines the architecture, implementation, security measures, and operational considerations for the solution.

2. Solution Architecture
The proposed architecture consists of the following AWS services:
- AWS IoT Core: Captures real-time energy consumption data from the IoT box.
- AWS Lambda: Processes incoming IoT data and forwards it to storage.
- Amazon S3: Stores processed energy consumption data for analytics and long-term storage.
- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors Lambda executions and logs for debugging.
- AWS IAM: Manages access control and security.

Data Flow
1. IoT box publishes energy consumption data to AWS IoT Core.
2. IoT Rule forwards messages to AWS Lambda.
3. AWS Lambda processes data and stores it in Amazon S3.
4. Amazon CloudWatch logs execution details and errors.

 3. Implementation Details
 Terraform Code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is used to automate deployment:
- AWS IoT Core topic and rule
- Lambda function for processing data
- IAM roles and permissions
- S3 bucket for storage
- CloudWatch logging

 AWS Service Choices Justification
- AWS IoT Core: Handles real-time data ingestion securely.
- AWS Lambda: Reduces operational overhead and scales automatically.
- Amazon S3: Low-cost storage for large datasets.
- CloudWatch: Ensures observability and debugging capabilities.

 4. Security Measures
- Data Encryption:
  - TLS encryption for data in transit.
  - S3 bucket encryption at rest using AWS-managed keys.
- IAM Role-Based Access Control:
  - Least privilege principle enforced.
  - Lambda functions and IoT rules have specific permissions.
- Monitoring & Logging:
  - CloudWatch tracks API calls and Lambda executions.
  - AWS IAM policies enforce access restrictions.

 5. Cost Optimization
- Serverless Approach: AWS Lambda eliminates the need for dedicated compute resources.
- S3 Storage Class Optimization: Uses Standard-Infrequent Access for cost efficiency.
- Event-Driven Processing: Avoids unnecessary resource consumption.

 6. High Availability & Fault Tolerance
- AWS IoT Core and Lambda: Provide automatic scaling and fault tolerance.
- CloudWatch Alarms: Trigger alerts on failures.
- Retry Mechanisms: Lambda retries failed executions.

 7. Data Batching (Bonus)
To reduce costs and optimize performance, data can be batched before storing in S3:
- IoT Rule with Kinesis Firehose: Buffers and compresses data before sending to S3.
- Lambda Aggregation: Accumulates data in memory before writing to S3 in batches.

 8. Conclusion
This solution meets the key requirements of cost-effectiveness, security, high availability, and low latency. Future enhancements can include real-time analytics using Amazon Athena or QuickSight for visualization.
